## Disable pop-up blocking for docs.google.com

Most browsers these days block pop-up windows by default. Unfortunately, this interferes with the operation of Boffo's help menu item:

<div align="center">
<img width="500px" src="_static/media/get-help.png">
</div>

This menu option tries to open a link to the Boffo help pages, but browser pop-up or content blockers or other browser security settings can prevent Boffo from being able to open the help pages directly. When that happens, Boffo has to resort to showing a dialog and asking the user to click on a link in the dialog in order to open a separate window on the help pages. To avoid this annoyance, you may wish to allow pop-ups on the domain docs.google.com. 

### If you use Safari

5. Click on the pop-up menu and select _Allow_ from the list
