# Installation

For Caltech Library staff, Boffo is available from the Google Marketplace for add-ons.


## Using Google Marketplace

To install Boffo, look for the _Extensions_ menu at the top of your Google sheet, click on it, then click on the item _Get add-ons_ from the _Add-ons_ submenu:

</p>

In the Google Workspace Marketplace panel that is shown next, click on the button titled _Internal apps_ near the top:

<p align="center">

</p>

This will change the panel to show apps available for the Caltech Library staff. Boffo should be visible there. Click on the item for Boffo,

<p align="center">

</p>

which will make the Google panel show more details about Boffo and a blue _Install_ button:

<p align="center">

</p>

Click on the _Install_ button. Google will show you several dialogs asking for your permission to install Boffo. Accept and allow the installation, then close the Google Marketplace panel.

### Incorrect post-installation notification panel

Note that after you install Boffo as an add-on in a Google Sheet, Google will show you a pop-up titled "Boffo has been installed!" that looks like this:

<p align="center">
<img width="600px" src="_static/media/google-screen-after-boffo-installation.png">
</p>

This pop-up states that Boffo has been installed under a menu titled _Add-ons_, but **this is incorrect**. In fact, Google installs it in a menu titled _Extensions_. Please **ignore the instructions to look for an _Add-ons_ menu**. This pop-up is automatically generated by Google's system and not under the control of Boffo, and we can't make changes to it.
