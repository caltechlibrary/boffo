## Introduction

## Installation

## Quick start

## Usage

## Known issues and limitations

The Boffo menu includes a "Get Help" item.

</div>

This opens a link to the Boffo help pages, but browser pop-up or content blockers or other browser security settings can prevent Boffo from being able to open the help pages directly. In that case, it has to resort to showing a dialog and asking the user to click on a link in the dialog in order to open a separate window on the help pages. To avoid this annoyance, you may wish to allow pop-ups on the domain docs.google.com. On Safari, you can do this as follows:
1. Open Safari's Settings
2. Click on _Websites_ in the top list of panels
3. Find and click on "Pop-up Windows" in the left-hand list
4. Look for docs.google.com in the list on the right-hand side
5. Click on the pop-up menu and select _Allow_ from the list
