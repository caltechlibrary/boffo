## Introduction

Boffo (_**B**arc**o**des **f**rom **FO**LIO_) is an add-on for [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) written by the [Caltech Library](https://library.caltech.edu/library/home). It lets you select item barcodes in a spreadsheet and retrieve information about the [item records](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/boffo/glossary) from a [FOLIO](https://folio.org) server.

## Installation

For Caltech Library staff, Boffo is available from the Google Marketplace for add-ons. To install it, look for the _Extensions_ menu at the top of your Google sheet, click on it, then click on the item _Get add-ons_ from the _Add-ons_ submenu:

</p>

In the Google Workspace Marketplace panel that is shown next, click on the button titled _Internal apps_ near the top:

<p align="center">

</p>

This will change the panel to show apps available for the Caltech Library staff. Boffo should be visible there. Click on the item for Boffo,

<p align="center">
<img width="600px" src="docs/_static/media/boffo-in-google-marketplace.png">
</p>

which will make the Google panel show more details about Boffo and a blue _Install_ button:

<img width="600px" src="docs/_static/media/boffo-installation-button.png">
</p>

Click on the _Install_ button. Google will show you several dialogs asking for your permission to install Boffo. Accept and allow the installation, then close the Google Marketplace panel.


## Quick start




## Usage

When you first use it in a Google sheet, Boffo will initially request your FOLIO account login and password, but it only uses that information to ask FOLIO for an API token. Boffo never stores your FOLIO login or password, nor does it need any other personal information to do its work.


## Known issues and limitations

Immediately after you install Boffo as an add-on in a Google Sheet, Google will show you a pop-up titled "Boffo has been installed!" that looks like this:

<p align="center">
<img width="600px" src="docs/_static/media/google-screen-after-boffo-installation.png">
</p>

This pop-up is incorrect: it states that Boffo has been installed under a menu titled _Add-ons_, but in fact, Google installs it in a menu titled _Extensions_. Please ignore the instructions to look for an _Add-ons_ menu. This pop-up is automatically generated by Google's system and not under the control of Boffo, and we can't make changes to it.
