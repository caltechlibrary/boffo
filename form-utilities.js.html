 // The need to name this file form-utilities.js.html instead of
 // form-utilities.js is because HTMLService in Google Apps Script doesn't
 // recognize files that don't have a .html suffix.

 // Call host.close() after a delay. Needed for 2 reasons:
 //
 // 1) It seems that calls made after gs.host.close() are not executed,
 //    which is a critical problem for what we need to do. In particular,
 //    one of the things done here is to call a subsequent function after
 //    interacting with the user and closing the dialog. Since calling
 //    gs.host.close() seems to prevent anything else from happening, we
 //    can't just call gs.host.close() to close the dialog and then make
 //    our call; conversely, we can't make our call first and afterwards
 //    close the dialog, because then the dialog stays visible the whole
 //    time our code is working on (e.g.) looking up barcodes. Solution:
 //    we put the gs.host.close() on a timer, which lets us make our call
 //    while the timer runs in parallel and (after a delay) calls close().
 //
 // 2) It seems that even calls made right *before* gs.host.close() also
 //    don't get executed (or at least, if I call Logger.log right before
 //    it, the log statement doesn't show in Google's cloud log.) Once
 //    again, a delay between the call and gs.host.close() solves it.
 //
 // Problem #2 is why other code never calls gs.host.close()
 // directly, even in cases where problem #1 is not at stake.
 function delayedClose(duration = 300) {
   setTimeout(() => { google.script.host.close(); }, duration);
