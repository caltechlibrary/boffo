# The only documentation for the .claspignore file that I ever found is at
# https://github.com/google/clasp#ignore-file-claspignore
# The file format is multimatch (https://github.com/sindresorhus/multimatch).
# According to the README in the GitHub repo for clasp:
#   "If no .claspignore is specified, a default set of patterns is applied.
#   This default set will only consider the appsscript.json manifest and any
#   JavaScript, TypeScript and .html source files within the rootDir folder.
#   Child folders other than .git and node_modules are processed."
