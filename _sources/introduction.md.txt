# Introduction

Boffo (_**B**arc**o**des **f**rom **FO**LIO_) is an add-on for Google Sheets written by the Caltech Library. It lets you select item barcodes in a spreadsheet and retrieve information about the item records from a FOLIO server. Boffo creates a new sheet titled "Item Data" in the spreadsheet where you ran it, and adds the results of the item lookups to the new sheet.
