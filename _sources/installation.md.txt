# Installation

For Caltech Library staff, Boffo is available from the Google Marketplace for add-ons.


## Using Google Marketplace

To install Boffo, look for the _Extensions_ menu at the top of your Google sheet, click on it, then click on the item _Get add-ons_ from the _Add-ons_ submenu:

</figure>

In the Google Workspace Marketplace panel that is shown next, click on the button titled _Internal apps_ near the top:

<figure>
<img class="shadow" width="800px" src="_static/media/google-marketplace-panel.png">
</figure>

This will change the panel to show apps available for the Caltech Library staff. Boffo should be visible there. Click on the item for Boffo,

<figure>
<img class="shadow" width="800px" src="_static/media/boffo-in-google-marketplace.png">
</figure>

which will make the Google panel show more details about Boffo and a blue _Install_ button:

<figure>
<img class="shadow" width="800px" src="_static/media/boffo-installation-button.png">
</figure>

Click on the _Install_ button. Google will show you several dialogs asking for your permission to install Boffo. Accept and allow the installation, then close the Google Marketplace panel.

### Incorrect post-installation notification panel

Note that after you install Boffo as an add-on in a Google Sheet, Google will show you a pop-up titled "Boffo has been installed!" that looks like this:

<figure>
<img class="shadow" width="800px" src="_static/media/google-screen-after-boffo-installation.png">
</figure>

This pop-up states that Boffo has been installed under a menu titled _Add-ons_, but **this is incorrect**. In fact, Google installs it in a menu titled _Extensions_. Please **ignore the instructions to look for an _Add-ons_ menu**. This pop-up is automatically generated by Google's system and not under the control of Boffo, and we can't make changes to it.


## Directly from source

If you are not at Caltech, you will not be able find Boffo in the Google Marketplace for add-ons. Instead, you will have to use install the code from the source files in some way. The following subsections describe two possible methods.

### Copying the Google Apps Script project

This process does not require the use of command-line tools or coding experience, but it does require some patience and care because some of the steps below are very unintuitive.

1. (Optional, but recommended for your sanity.) Create a folder in your Google Drive where you will put the Boffo project files that will be created in the following steps. For the purposes of this documentation, assume that this folder is named _Boffo example_.
2. Go to the [public folder for Boffo in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PJErJ2ggFqT5H7pQkYr0wrpnf6YorHc-?usp=share_link). It should look more or less like what is shown in the screenshot below.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/boffo-google-drive-folder.png"></p>
3. Right-click over the Boffo project and select _Make a copy_ from the contextual menu that pops up.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/google-drive-make-copy.jpg"></p>
4. Go to the location where the copy ended up (usually the top level of your Google Drive) and look for the newly-created GAS project named _Copy of Boffo (public copy)_. Right-click on it, and select _Move to_ from the contextual menu that pops-up.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/google-drive-move.png"></p>
5. From the move dialog, select the destination (in this example, the folder named _Boffo example_ suggested in step #1 above).<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/google-drive-move-destination.png"></p>
6. Navigate to the destination folder in your Google Drive.
7. (Optional, but why not?) Rename the project file _Copy of Boffo (public copy)_ to something less annoying, such as just _Boffo_.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/google-drive-rename.png"></p>
8. Create a spreadsheet in the folder next to the _Boffo_ apps script project. For the purposes of this documentation, assume this spreadsheet is named _Example spreadsheet_.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/google-drive-example-spreadsheet.png"></p>
9. Double-click on the _Boffo_ apps script project (not the spreadsheet!). It should look more or less like the screenshot below.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/gas-editor.png"></p>
10. Click on the blue _Deploy_ button at the top of the page, and select _Test deployments_ from the pull-down menu.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/gas-editor-deployments.png"></p>
11. In dialog that opens next, note the list in the left-hand sidebar shows "Google Workspace Add-on" as the default. This is the wrong deployment to use for our purposes.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/gas-editor-deployments-wrong-kind.png"></p>
12. Changing the deployment will take two steps. Click the gear icon next to _Select type_ and a pop-up menu will be shown. In this pop-up, you will initially find a check-mark next to "Google Workspace Add-on". Select it to _uncheck_ that item. The pop-up will disappear; click on the gear icon a second time, and now select "Editor Add-on". You should end up with the configuration shown in the screenshot below.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/gas-editor-deployments-right-kind.png"></p>
13. With the configuration changed to "Editor Add-on", click on the button _Create new test_,<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/gas-editor-create-test.png"></p>
14. In the dialog that pops up, click on the up arrow icon in the 3rd field (under "Test document").<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/gas-editor-create-test.png"></p>
15. In the Google Drive selection dialog that is shown next, select the spreadsheet created in step #8 above. and click the blue _Insert_ button in the selection dialog.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/gas-editor-select-spreadsheet.png"></p>
16. The selection dialog will close, and back in the test deployments dialog, click the blue _Save test_ button.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/gas-editor-save-test.png"></p>
17. We're not done yet! The deployments dialog will change, and now will look like the screenshot below. Click the circle next on the line with the name of the spreadsheet you selected.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/gas-editor-click-radio-box.png"></p>
18. Now click on the blue word _Execute_ which will become active as a result of clicking the circle in the previous step.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/gas-editor-click-execute.png"></p>
19. In an exciting development, the deployment dialog will close and your spreadsheet will open in a new tab or window in your browser. Click on the Extensions menubar item …<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/gas-editor-spreadsheet.png"></p>
20. … and here, finally, Boffo's menu will be available in your spreadsheet. And it took only 20 steps to get to this point. Easy, wasn't it?<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/gas-editor-boffo-installed.png"></p>


### Using `clasp` to push source files to a GAS project

If you are comfortable with using command-line tools and GitHub, and perhaps want to change Boffo or use it as a starting point for other projects, you can follow the process described next.

1. Clone the [GitHub project for Boffo](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/boffo) to a local directory on your computer, if you have not already done so.
2. Install the command-line utility [`clasp`](https://github.com/google/clasp) if you do not already have it. It lets you maintain your Google Apps Script project files in GitHub and edit them locally, and push them from your local computer to a Google Apps Script project.
3. Create a new Google Apps Script project in your Google Drive.
4. In the Apps Script project interface for this newly-created project, click on the gear icon in the left-hand column.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/new-project.png"></p>
5. From the project settings page, copy the Script ID.<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="_static/media/copy-script-id.png"></p>
6. In your local clone of the Boffo repository, open the file `.clasp.json` in a text editor, and change the value of the field `scriptId` to the value you copied in step #5. For example, if the value you copied was `1hio_6Izyd4908yE4rRy9wUjyIuh0z3jtxy2bb_zBPy9YtPVC6Bh-fv7`, you would change the contents of `.clasp.json` to be
    ```json
    {"scriptId": "1hio_6Izyd4908yE4rRy9wUjyIuh0z3jtxy2bb_zBPy9YtPVC6Bh-fv7"}
    ```
7. Now run `clasp push` to push the Boffo source files to the (empty, freshly-created) Google Apps Script project:
    ```sh
    clasp push
    ```
    Google will ask you to authorize the transfer. Follow the directions to do so.

After this process, you should end up with a copy of the Boffo source files in your Google Apps Project. From there, you can edit the application as well as deploy the new version in your spreadsheets by following a process similar to the one described in the previous section.
