## Execution time limits

Depending on your account type, Boffo will run into Google quotas limiting maximum execution time. For G Suite users such as the Caltech Library, this limit is 30 minutes. For non-G Suite users, the limit is 6 minutes. At the time of this writing, Boffo can retrieve item records at a rate of about 70--100/second, which translates to somewhere between 4200 and 6000 records per minute.
