## Execution time limits

Depending on your account type, Boffo will run into Google quotas limiting maximum execution time. For G Suite users such as the Caltech Library, this limit is 30 minutes, which ends up being enough for about 1100 items at a time. For non-G Suite users, the limit is 6 minutes.
