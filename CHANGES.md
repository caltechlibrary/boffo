# Change log for Boffo

## Version 1.1.0

User-visible changes in this version:
* The field named "effective shelving order" is no longer printed in the output sheet for barcode lookups, following a discussion with Caltech Library staff (who reported that they didn't find it useful).
* The documentation has been slightly updated.

Other changes in this version:
* Release tags in GitHub once again start with the letter `v`, as in `v1.2.3`.
* The Makefile has been overhauled, with internal functions implemented differently and some more automation added.
